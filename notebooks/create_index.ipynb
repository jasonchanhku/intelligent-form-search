    "Semantic ranking can generate answers to a query string that has the characteristics of a question. The generated answer is extracted verbatim from your content. To get a semantic answer, the question and answer must be closely aligned, and the model must find content that clearly answers the question. If potential answers fail to meet a confidence threshold, the model doesn't return an answer. For demonstration purposes, the question in this example is designed to get a response so that you can see the syntax."
